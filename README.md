### Hi, I am Hugo ðŸ‘‹

I have a PhD in Geophysics where I worked on Seismic Imaging methods using Machine Learning. I work for Earth Rover Program as a Research Scientist where I am responsible for the software engineering. I love programming and you can often find me doing "geeky stuff" (as my partner calls it).

#### My "geeky stuff" ðŸ¤“:
- [Stateful Scenes](https://github.com/hugobloem/stateful_scenes): A Home Assistant integration to analyse the state of scenes.
- [Microsoft STT using Wyoming](https://github.com/hugobloem/wyoming-microsoft-stt): Speech-to-text processing using Microsoft Azure for Home Assistant and Rhasspy.
- [Microsoft TTS using Wyoming](https://github.com/hugobloem/wyoming-microsoft-stt): Text-to-speech processing using Microsoft Azure for Home Assistant and Rhasspy.
- [esp-ha-speech](https://github.com/hugobloem/esp-ha-speech): Proof-of-concept using speech recognition on a low-power microcontroller.

#### Trivia
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently low-level embedded programming
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything Home Assistant or Geophysics
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/hugobloem) or open an issue. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: The Dutch flag ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± is the oldest tri-colour in the world.
